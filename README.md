# `whatsfordinner`

This is to help me with grocery and meal prepping without having to go through some serious decision fatigue.

Find 30 recipes that I like, are fairly easy to cook, and are affordable, have a pretty basic algorithm pick out recipes for week-ish and generate a grocery list


## Schema

In a folder called `database` each file is a recipe in itself like `caesar_salad.recipe`, this follows the struct `Recipe` as defined in `recipes.rs`. 

`pantry.store` keeps track of what is there in the pantry and plans accordingly.
